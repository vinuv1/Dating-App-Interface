## 🧩 Future Ideas & Improvements

- Add interactive behavior (e.g. card swiping, like/dislike animations) with JavaScript  
- Add dark mode / alternate themes  
- Build a backend API and connect the UI to real data (user profiles, matches)  
- Add authentication / user login + profile editing  
- Make components modular / convert to a front-end framework (React / Vue) for scalability
